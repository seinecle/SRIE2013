[NEXT SLIDE] my current interests

##Why should we care about the digital humanities?
The computers have been around since the 1940s!, and from the start some applications for the humanities came along.
I quote from the "History of Humanities Computing" by [Susan Hockey](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-2-1):

"In 1949, an Italian Jesuit priest, [Father Roberto Busa](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/classicsfacpub/70/), began what even to this day is a monumental task: to make an *index verborum* of all the words in the works of St Thomas Aquinas and related authors, totaling some 11 million words of medieval Latin. The entire texts were gradually transferred to punched cards and a concordance program written for the project".

Still taken from this history of the digital humanities by Susan Hockey, statisticians [Mosteller and Wallace (1964)](http://books.google.nl/books?id=g7wbAQAAMAAJ) tried to decipher who was the main author of 12 of the Federalist Papers, this famous set of 85 essays written collectively by the fathers of the American constitution. They performed an exercise in computer-based authorship investigation, so when you think of it, computer-based stylometry is 50 years old!

The Association for Computers and the Humanities was created in 1978, personal computers are 30 years old, and Internet and the World Wide Web are around for a quarter of century now.

So, what is suddenly so urgent today and novel about the digital humanities?

I mean, we are not even sure that more computers always bring interesting things. Economic historians will remember the cliometrics movement - the quantitative and statistical approach to historical studies. Did not really take off.

Other might remember learning the PASCAL or BASIC programming languages at some point in their childhood? Hours of instructions to learn how to draw a triangle on a screen? That was the time in the 80's when some parents thought that "children should learn Japanese and computers to stay ahead in the competitive economy" - turned out it was very unnecessary. [they should have learnt Chinese...]

##So again, why should we, today, care about the digital humanities?

Well, for several reasons.

I would start by evoking the amazing increase in computing power and storage capacity, but I think this is well known so I won't expand on this.

Rather, this is really an obvious point but this is rarely stressed: in the last 15 years, we  have transitioned to a digital culture. It happened so quickly that we may not realize it, so let me repeat these boring facts, all of these routine cultural activities that appeared in the last 15 years:

We access music and movies from computers, watch TV programs on Youtube.
We read newspapers on computers, we send emails.
We check our bank statements online, pay our taxes online, check in and check out with digital cards for every tram, bus or metro we take.

[NEXT SLIDE] - Google latitude

[Just an aside here: even walking leaves a digital trace, I found out. Want to be scared? If you have a Google account, check www.google.com/latitude]

We use a GPS when driving to a new destination.  
We take our pics with a digital camera, share them online, and rarely print them.  
We create art on computers. We design, prototype, print in 3D even, all from our computers.  
We find partners with online dating websites, call them on Skype, text them with Whatsapp.  
We learn from Jstor, Wikipedia, communicate with students with dedicated online platform such as the Blackboard,   
We find our way with Google maps, check if it's going to rain in the next 10 minutes with BuitenRadar,   
We buy stuff on Amazon and resell them on Ebay or Marktplaats.nl, and we get clues about which restaurant, hotel, or holiday destination to go to by comparing online descriptions and rankings.   
We socialize on Twitter and Foursquare. We find jobs on LinkedIn, and reconnect with old friends on Facebook.  
And since a few years, all of that extended from the desktop computer to the mobile phone, and now the tablets, waiting for the glasses that Google is developing.  

Let me say it again: in the last 15 years, human cultural activities, at least in economically advanced countries, have increasingly been conducted in a digital form, leaving digital traces.  

Now, what are the humanities dealing with?

The Oxford English Dictionary includes [this definition](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/89280) of the humanities: "The branch of learning concerned with human culture".


So that's a major turn, this is a major difference with just 10 years ago, the digital humanities have major claim to a (re)birth date: there is a digital culture to be studied. What difference does it make? Let's take an example:

[NEXT SLIDE] Paul and Ale.

In the context of [NESSHI](http://nesshi.eu), a 3-years project funded by the NWO and other European agencies, with co-authors [Ale Smidts](http://www.rsm.nl/people/ale-smidts/) and [Paul Wouters](http://research.cwts.nl/converis/person/1352) I am currently studying [the emergence of neuromarketing](http://www.clementlevallois.net/sandbox/timeline/index.html), a new domain of knowledge involving neuroscientists and marketers, that appeared in the early 2000s. We are interested in the media representations of neuromarketing. So did we look at the NY Times, de NRC, the Guardian etc? Yes, but we also realized that these journals are today a tiny subsample of the places where news making happens.

Blogs, internet forums, commercial websites, tweets, the homepage of academics, the advertisements on your Facebook page etc... The world wide web is today a major source of news reporting and news making. To evaluate and understand a cultural phenomenon it is essential to take these sources into account. It takes quite some effort to dig into it, but ignoring it would mean ignoring an important component of what culture is made of.

##The place of computers in the methodology of the digital humanities

###We can do without them
Working on digital content quickly opens the issue of, which research methods are adequate for this study? Basically, since we deal with digital data, should the computers be brought in? In my view that is not a prerequisite, at least not where you would expect them. To continue with the previous example, the webpages on neuromarketing were collected by hand, by which I mean that a research assistant performed looots of google searches, not using any form of automated web crawling. Why? Well humans still do better than computers on many scores, for example to evaluate the relevance of a document. At the end the research assistant collected about 1,600 unique documents. We thought, that's a lot and surely we can't read all of it, let's do some complex semantic analysis, like topic extraction, to get a summary of it. It did not work that well, and we kept coming back to the original documents to make confirmations. In this end, we realized that to understand fully the dataset, the best way was still to read through all of it. Which doesn't take that much time actually.

[NEXT SLIDE] Pictures of brains in Dutch media

This is not an isolated example, we currently have [another project](http://nesshi.eu) looking at the place of neuroscience in contemporary culture. So last autumn I went through 300,000 pages of the NRC and the Telegraaf, taking issues from the past 25 years, looking for brains and photographying them.


No computer can do that. Human collection is precise and that's invaluable, as anybody who had to clean bad data knows.

So, the digital humanities are not doomed by computers that will "number crunch" any dataset that you will feed them. Just read the dataset yourself.

[NEXT SLIDE] Shameless plug

A footnote here: I have nothing against number crunching, and other algorithmic alchemistry: I practice it myself and I find it fascinating.

### Computers: so much more than just number crunchers
But in my view, it is worth insisting on other kinds of contributions that computers make to the humanities. To see that we must look at computers differently, not just number crunchers. We must also agree that the humanities are not only the learning concerned with human culture, but also the creation of new forms of culture. Artistic performances, installations in museums, the recitation of a poem, are closely associated with the humanities: other sciences might be concerned with the objective and the causal but the humanities deal with the meaningful, the inspiring, and the beautiful. If so, the digital turn in the humanities leads to the creation of beautiful things indeed. Take some talented programmers, three Microsoft Kinect, and a dancer:

And this is just one example, if we have time I'll provide another one at the end. Let's continue with the acknowledgment that the "digital humanities" is so much more than doing number crunching on massive datasets. I mentioned the digital as provider of beauty, here is another one: story-telling. So far, scholars in the humanities tell their stories mainly through books, academic articles, conference presentations and the like. The digital turn is certaingly helping these forms of story telling to evolve (online repositories, collabs, enhanced publications, etc.), but it can also provide entirely new forms of story telling. Visual interfaces, such as a web interfaces, remain largely unexplored in their possibilities, even if the capabilities are clearly there:

Aaronetrope:

Stanford's two installations co-created with [Elijah Meeks](https://dhs.stanford.edu/author/emeeks/) the last two years, [ORBIS](http://orbis.stanford.edu/) and the [Republic of Letters](https://republicofletters.stanford.edu/tools/), are examples of achievements in this domain, where the scholarly study blends with the user interface and the underlying data. The general point I want to make here is that the computer sciences bring the very helpful concepts of "user interfaces" and "user experience" (UI and UX in their jargon), which forces the inventors to think of how the product they build is going to be perceived and effectively used by the intended audience. The humanities could adopt this way of thinking to develop creations that would be even more engaging, meaningful and beautiful.

##Why are the digital humanities coming soon to a campus near you
There would be so many things to add, but I'd like to leave room for questions, and finish with a discussion of "why are the digital humanities arriving on your campus soon". The humanities are not alone in experiencing a digital turn, other disciplines follow the same trend, and industries too. I mean, we can see that with all [the presentations of today](http://www.surfsites.nl/srie13/programma/402-surf-research-and-innovation-event-2013/), or by reading the Harvard Business Review about how data scientist is the [sexiest job of the twenty first century](http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/ar/1). In practice though, when you look at our universities (in the Netherlands and abroad), there is a quasi-absence of curriculum training future researchers and professionals in the digital side of their specialties. I watch these developments closely and my personal impression is that surprisingly maybe, the humanities are taking a strong lead in it, ahead of the social sciences and the natural sciences. That might have to do with text and language being so central to the humanities, which are core aspects of the digital turn. Or to the fact that the humanities are close to libraries and library science, which have a head start in dealing with metadata, large databases and information retrieval. In any case, the result is that the digital humanities have developed a strong network of individual researchers and research centers, to the point that "the digital humanities" are now becoming synonymous with the digital approach to a variety of social issues, not only the humanities. And since the interest in digital scholarship in society is increasing, not decreasing, I would expect that new initiatives in this domain will place themselves under the banner of the digital humanities.

Thank you! I leave you with another beautiful artifact from the digital humanities:

## Post-scriptum: the Golden Triangle of Impact
After my presentation yesterday, somebody in the audience asked, "but is this kind of digital humanities (concerned with inventive user interfaces, beauty, and creating artful forms) fitting in departments of universities?". To which I replied that it was a matter of taste, and that I'd love to join a department which embraced this conception of the digital humanities.

I heard chuckles in the audience, so I understood that I had missed something. That kept me thinking. Surely the question was, at the bottom, "beauty, invention and performances are all fine, but how can it be justified to the department chair / the funding body / the research evaluation agencies?" Ohhh, that....!!

So let me rephrase my answer: your department chair will love you for that. The reason is that this kind of DH fits the Golden Triangle of Impact<sup>TM</sup> : interesting publications get written on the way, social relevance is at the heart of these DH projects, and it brings material departments and schools can easily communicate about. That should make of the digital humanities a hot candidate for any department.
